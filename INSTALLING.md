## Installation
1. Download the latest package from the [releases page](https://github.com/brz-gta5/fivem-brz-fishing-ts/releases).
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into your resources folder.
3. Make sure the resource is added to your server.cfg file.

ensure brz-fishing
```
4. If you are not using our BRZFramework, you will need to add the fishing items to your inventory items. Open the `installation` folder and copy the items relevant for the framework you use.
